## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the project locally:

Since this project uses **Serverless Functions**, the standard `node server.js` command won't work. To simulate the production environment locally:

1.  **Clone the Repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CHMAhmad24/ElectroMart.git
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd FrontEnd
    npm install
    cd BackEnd
    ```
3.  **Install Vercel CLI (Optional but Recommended):**
    To run serverless functions locally:
    ```bash
    npm i -g vercel
    ```
4.  **Run the Project:**
    ```bash
    vercel dev
    ```
    *This command will start both the frontend and the serverless backend on your local machine.*
    ```
